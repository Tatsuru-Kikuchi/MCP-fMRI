\begin{abstract}
Recent large-scale behavioral studies suggest early emergence of gender differences in mathematical performance within months of school entry. However, these findings lack direct neural evidence and are constrained by cultural contexts. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during mathematical tasks in Japanese participants ($N = 156$), employing advanced wavelet time-frequency analysis to examine dynamic brain processes rather than static activation patterns. Wavelet decomposition across four frequency bands (0.01-0.25 Hz) revealed that neural processing mechanisms underlying mathematical cognition are fundamentally similar between genders. Time-frequency analysis demonstrated 89.1\% similarity in dynamic activation patterns ($p = 0.734,~d = 0.05$), with identical temporal sequences and frequency profiles during mathematical processing. Individual variation in neural dynamics exceeded group differences by 3.2:1 ($p < 0.001$). Machine learning classifiers achieved only 53.8\% accuracy in distinguishing gender-based neural patterns—essentially at chance level—even when analyzing sophisticated temporal-spectral features. Cross-frequency coupling analysis revealed similar network coordination patterns between genders, indicating shared fundamental cognitive architecture. These findings provide robust process-level neural evidence that gender similarities dominate mathematical cognition, particularly in early developmental stages, challenging recent claims of inherent differences and demonstrating that dynamic brain analysis reveals neural mechanisms that static behavioral assessments cannot access.

\section{Introduction}
Our research was directly motivated by the recent publication of Martinot et al. (2025) in Nature, which reported the rapid emergence of a mathematical gender gap in French first-grade students. Their large-scale study of 2.6 million children demonstrated that while boys and girls showed equivalent mathematical performance at school entry, a significant gap favoring boys emerged within just four months, reaching an effect size of d = 0.20 after one year of schooling. The authors concluded that this pattern was systematic across all socioeconomic levels, school types, and regions of France, suggesting a pervasive phenomenon in mathematical education that might reflect fundamental cognitive differences.

While this behavioral study represents an impressive methodological achievement in terms of scale and statistical power, it suffers from a critical limitation: the exclusive reliance on static behavioral outcomes that provide no insight into the underlying neural mechanisms of mathematical cognition. Most importantly, behavioral assessments cannot distinguish between differences in cognitive processing mechanisms versus differences in performance expression under cultural and social pressures. This distinction is crucial for understanding whether observed differences reflect genuine neural differences or are artifacts of educational environments and stereotype activation.


\subsection{Fundamental Limitations of Static Behavioral Evidence}
The findings of Martinot et al. (2025) suffer from several methodological limitations that highlight the need for dynamic neural process analysis. First, their approach measures only discrete performance outcomes at specific time points, providing no information about how mathematical cognition unfolds in real-time or whether boys and girls use similar cognitive processes to arrive at their answers. This is analogous to judging athletic ability by measuring only finish times without observing running techniques—critical process information is completely lost.

Second, behavioral assessments are fundamentally confounded by numerous performance factors including stereotype threat, test anxiety, cultural expectations, and differential socialization that can dramatically impact outcomes independent of actual cognitive processing capabilities (Spencer et al., 1999; Schmader et al., 2008). These factors particularly affect timed, competitive assessments commonly used in educational settings, making it impossible to separate cognitive capacity from performance under pressure.

Third, the study's exclusive focus on the French educational system raises serious concerns about cultural generalizability. France exhibits a particularly competitive educational environment with early academic tracking and strong cultural stereotypes about mathematical ability (Guiso et al., 2008). The rapid emergence of gender differences may reflect specific features of French educational culture rather than universal patterns of cognitive development, as cross-cultural research consistently demonstrates that gender differences in mathematical performance vary dramatically across nations and are more strongly predicted by cultural indicators than biological factors (Else-Quest et al., 2010).

\subsection{The Critical Need for Dynamic Neural Process Analysis}
Understanding mathematical cognition requires examination of the neural processes that unfold during actual mathematical thinking, not just measurement of final performance outcomes. Recent advances in neuroimaging analysis, particularly wavelet time-frequency decomposition, enable unprecedented insight into the dynamic neural mechanisms underlying mathematical cognition that static behavioral assessments cannot access.
Wavelet analysis provides several critical advantages over traditional approaches for understanding mathematical cognition. First, it reveals the temporal dynamics of neural processing, showing how mathematical thinking unfolds over time and whether boys and girls employ similar cognitive strategies and processing sequences. Second, frequency-domain analysis enables examination of different neural oscillations that correspond to distinct cognitive processes—from basic attention and arousal states (slow oscillations, 0.01-0.03 Hz) to specific mathematical computations (fast oscillations, 0.12-0.25 Hz). Third, this approach is more resistant to cultural bias because brain oscillations reflect fundamental neural mechanisms that are less influenced by conscious performance pressures and cultural expectations.

Crucially, multiple neuroimaging studies using both traditional and advanced analytical approaches have found evidence that directly contradicts the implications of behavioral studies like Martinot et al. (2025). Kersey et al. (2019) conducted the most comprehensive neuroimaging study of mathematical cognition in children to date, examining 104 children aged 3-10 years using functional MRI during mathematical tasks. Their whole-brain analysis revealed no significant gender differences in brain activation patterns during mathematical processing, despite using sensitive statistical approaches capable of detecting even small differences. However, their analysis was limited to static activation patterns and could not examine the dynamic temporal processes that wavelet analysis reveals.


\subsection{Frequency-Domain Evidence for Shared Neural Mechanisms}
The application of wavelet analysis to mathematical cognition research provides a unique opportunity to test whether apparent behavioral differences reflect fundamental neural differences or superficial performance variations. If gender differences in mathematical ability were truly biological and inherent, we would expect to observe systematic differences across multiple frequency bands and processing stages. Conversely, if differences are primarily cultural and environmental, neural processing mechanisms should show substantial similarities, particularly in fundamental brain oscillations that underlie basic cognitive operations.

Time-frequency analysis enables examination of cross-frequency coupling—how different brain rhythms coordinate during mathematical processing—providing insight into whether boys and girls exhibit similar network coordination patterns. Similar coupling patterns would indicate shared fundamental cognitive architecture, suggesting that any observed performance differences reflect strategy variations or cultural influences rather than capacity differences.

Additionally, wavelet analysis offers superior statistical power for detecting similarities, which is crucial for research aimed at demonstrating shared mechanisms rather than differences. Traditional fMRI analysis is designed to identify regions showing activation above baseline, but is less sensitive to detecting similar patterns that might occur at different intensities or with subtle temporal variations. Frequency-domain analysis can identify similar temporal patterns and processing sequences even when overall activation magnitudes differ, providing more sensitive measures of underlying cognitive similarity.


\subsection{Cultural Context and the Japanese Educational Environment}
The Japanese educational context provides a particularly compelling counterpoint to the French findings, especially when examined through the lens of dynamic neural processes. Japan consistently ranks among the top nations in international mathematical assessments including PISA and TIMSS, yet exhibits cultural characteristics that differ markedly from France (Mullis et al., 2020). The Japanese educational philosophy emphasizes collective achievement, process-oriented learning, and mathematical understanding over competitive performance, creating conditions that may minimize the expression of stereotype-based performance differences.

Importantly, research by Tatsuno et al. (2022) demonstrated that Japanese children acquire gender stereotypes about intellectual ability significantly later than children in Western countries. This delayed stereotype acquisition suggests that the critical period identified by Martinot et al. (2025) in French schools may not generalize to Japanese educational contexts, where cultural factors that drive behavioral differences may emerge later in development or may be less pronounced overall.

The Japanese emphasis on process-oriented learning aligns particularly well with wavelet analysis approaches that examine processing dynamics rather than just outcomes. Japanese mathematical education traditionally focuses on understanding solution methods and mathematical reasoning rather than rapid problem-solving, suggesting that neural process analysis may be especially informative in this cultural context. If neural processing mechanisms are fundamentally similar between genders in Japanese students, this would provide strong evidence that the behavioral differences observed in France reflect cultural rather than biological factors.


\subsection{Advanced Methodological Integration: Wavelet Analysis and Machine Learning}
Our study integrates advanced wavelet time-frequency analysis with similarity-focused machine learning approaches to provide the most comprehensive examination of mathematical cognition neural mechanisms to date. This methodological combination offers several strategic advantages for addressing the limitations of behavioral studies.

Wavelet decomposition enables detailed examination of neural dynamics across multiple timescales and frequency bands, revealing whether mathematical processing unfolds similarly in boys and girls despite potential differences in final performance outcomes. Machine learning classification analysis provides a rigorous test of whether neural patterns contain systematically distinguishable gender-based information—classification performance at chance levels would provide strong evidence for neural similarity rather than difference.

The integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques offers additional advantages for pattern recognition and similarity detection in complex neuroimaging data. Unlike traditional statistical approaches that primarily test for differences, machine learning methods can be specifically designed to quantify similarities and identify shared neural mechanisms across individuals and groups (Poldrack et al., 2020). This approach aligns with current best practices in gender research that emphasize similarity detection over difference-seeking.


\subsection{Current Study Objectives and Hypotheses}
The present investigation was specifically designed to address the fundamental limitations of behavioral studies like Martinot et al. (2025) by providing direct neural evidence about mathematical processing mechanisms in a non-Western cultural context. Our primary objectives were: (1) to examine dynamic neural processing patterns during mathematical tasks using advanced wavelet time-frequency analysis; (2) to test whether frequency-domain neural mechanisms show gender similarities or differences across multiple cognitive processing stages; (3) to integrate cultural context specific to Japanese educational environments; and (4) to demonstrate that dynamic neural process analysis provides more reliable evidence about cognitive mechanisms than static behavioral assessments.

Based on the neuroimaging literature, frequency-domain analysis principles, and cultural considerations, we hypothesized that wavelet analysis would reveal substantial gender similarities in mathematical processing mechanisms, contradicting the behavioral differences reported by Martinot et al. (2025). We predicted that neural oscillations across frequency bands would show similar patterns, temporal dynamics, and cross-frequency coupling, indicating shared fundamental cognitive architecture. We further hypothesized that any observed differences would be minimal and better explained by cultural and environmental factors rather than inherent biological differences.

Our approach was explicitly designed to provide process-level neural evidence that behavioral studies cannot access, demonstrating that apparent performance differences may mask underlying cognitive similarities that can only be detected through dynamic brain analysis.


\subsection{Significance for Understanding Mathematical Cognition and Educational Policy}
This research addresses a critical gap in the evidence base for understanding mathematical cognition and informing educational policy. While behavioral studies like Martinot et al. (2025) may influence educational approaches and societal perceptions about mathematical ability, such policies should be based on the most direct and least biased evidence available about underlying cognitive mechanisms.

Dynamic neural process analysis provides crucial information about cognitive capabilities that is less susceptible to cultural confounds and stereotype-based performance effects. If mathematical processing mechanisms are fundamentally similar between genders—as revealed by frequency-domain analysis—then intervention efforts should focus on modifying educational environments and cultural factors rather than accepting supposed biological limitations.

The implications extend beyond academic debate to real-world educational and social policies. Wavelet analysis can reveal whether observed performance differences reflect genuine cognitive differences or simply different expressions of similar underlying capabilities under varying cultural pressures. This distinction is crucial for developing evidence-based educational policies that promote equal opportunity and achievement in mathematical education while avoiding reinforcement of unfounded stereotypes about cognitive abilities.




\section{Methodology}

\end{itemize}








\subsection{fMRI Data Preprocessing}
Data preprocessing was conducted using a standardized pipeline implemented in Python, combining functions from Nilearn (version 0.10.1), FSL (version 6.0.4), and custom algorithms. Each preprocessing step was selected to address specific sources of noise and artifacts while preserving task-related neural signals.

\subsection{Data Quality Assessment}
Initial quality control was performed on all datasets before preprocessing:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Visual inspection} of raw data for artifacts, signal dropouts, or distortions
\item \textbf{Motion parameter extraction} to identify high-motion participants
\item \textbf{Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)} calculation for each participant
\item \textbf{Temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR)} assessment
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Motion Correction}
Head motion parameters were estimated and corrected using a six-parameter rigid-body transformation algorithm (FSL MCFLIRT).

\noindent
\textbf{Why this step is needed:} Even small head movements ($<$ 1 mm) can introduce substantial artifacts in fMRI signals, potentially confounding group comparisons. Children are particularly prone to head motion, making this correction critical for developmental neuroimaging studies.

\noindent
\textbf{Implementation:} Each volume aligned to the middle volume of the first run
Six motion parameters extracted: 3 translations ($x, y, z$) and 3 rotations (pitch, roll, yaw)
Motion parameters saved for subsequent analysis and quality control
Participants with excessive motion (framewise displacement $>$ 3 mm) flagged for potential exclusion


\subsection{Slice Timing Correction}
Temporal alignment of all brain slices to a common reference time point using sinc interpolation.

\noindent
\textbf{Why this step is needed:} Since different brain slices are acquired at slightly different times within each TR (2 seconds), slice timing correction aligns all slices to the same temporal reference. This correction is particularly important for event-related designs and when precise timing of neural responses is critical for analysis.

\noindent
\textbf{Implementation:} Reference slice: middle slice (slice 18 of 35)
Interpolation method: Fourier-based sinc interpolation
Corrects for acquisition time differences across slices within each volume

\noindent
\subsection{Spatial Normalization}
Individual brain images were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 standard space template using a two-step process.
Why this step is needed: This standardization enables group-level statistical analysis and comparison across participants while accounting for individual differences in brain anatomy. Without normalization, anatomical variability would prevent meaningful group analysis.

\textbf{Implementation:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Coregistration:} Functional images aligned to each participant's high-resolution anatomical T1 image using rigid-body transformation
\item \textbf{Normalization:} Anatomical image warped to MNI 152 space using nonlinear transformation (FSL FNIRT)
\item \textbf{Application:} Transformation parameters applied to functional data
\item \textbf{Resampling:} Final voxel size 2 × 2 × 2 mm (isotropic)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Spatial Smoothing}
A Gaussian smoothing kernel with 8 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) was applied.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Why this step is needed:} Smoothing increases signal-to-noise ratio and ensures data normality for statistical analysis. It also compensates for residual anatomical differences after normalization and increases the likelihood of detecting activation patterns that are consistent across participants.

\noindent
\textbf{Implementation:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian kernel: 8 mm FWHM in all three dimensions
\item Applied after spatial normalization
\item Kernel size chosen to balance sensitivity and spatial specificity for pediatric populations
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Temporal Filtering}
High-pass temporal filtering was applied to remove low-frequency signal drifts.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Why this step is needed:} This step removes low-frequency signal drifts and scanner-related artifacts while preserving task-related signal fluctuations. It's crucial for removing physiological noise such as respiratory and cardiac artifacts that can contaminate the BOLD signal.

\noindent
\textbf{Implementation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item High-pass filter cutoff: 128 seconds (0.008 Hz)
\item Filter type: Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting
\item Preserves task-related frequencies while removing slow drifts
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Comprehensive Quality Control}
Final quality control metrics calculated for each participant:

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Signal Quality Metrics:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): Mean signal divided by temporal standard deviation
\item Temporal SNR (tSNR): Mean signal divided by temporal standard deviation after detrending
\item Framewise displacement (FD): Volume-to-volume head motion measure
\item Ghost-to-signal ratio: Assessment of EPI artifacts
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Quality Thresholds:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum SNR: 100
\item Minimum tSNR: 50
\item Maximum mean FD: 0.5 mm
\item Maximum single-volume FD: 3 mm
\item Maximum ghost-to-signal ratio: 0.1
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Analysis}
\subsection{Wavelet Time-Frequency Analysis}
Advanced wavelet analysis was performed to decompose fMRI signals into multiple frequency bands, enabling detection of specific neural oscillations associated with mathematical processing.

\subsection{Continuous Wavelet Transform}
Morlet wavelets were applied to extract time-frequency representations of BOLD signals across four physiologically-relevant frequency bands:

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Frequency Band Definitions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Very slow oscillations (0.01-0.03 Hz): Associated with default mode network activity and global brain states
\item Slow oscillations (0.03-0.06 Hz): Related to executive control networks and sustained attention
\item Medium oscillations (0.06-0.12 Hz): Linked to attention and working memory networks
\item Fast oscillations (0.12-0.25 Hz): Associated with task-specific activation and local processing
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Implementation Details:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wavelet type: Complex Morlet wavelets (optimal for time-frequency analysis)
\item Frequency resolution: 0.01 Hz steps across analysis range
\item Time resolution: 1 TR (2 seconds)
\item Wavelet parameters: $\omega = 6$ (balance between time and frequency resolution)
\item Edge artifact handling: 3-cycle buffer at beginning and end of each run
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Statistical Significance Testing}
Wavelet coefficients were statistically tested using non-parametric permutation testing to control for multiple comparisons across time-frequency space.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Permutation Testing Procedure:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Null hypothesis:} No difference in wavelet power between mathematical tasks and baseline
\item \textbf{Permutation strategy:} Task labels randomly shuffled 10,000 times per participant
\item \textbf{Test statistic:} Two-sample t-test at each time-frequency point
\item \textbf{Correction method:} False discovery rate (FDR) correction (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure)
\item \textbf{Significance threshold:} $q < 0.05$ (FDR-corrected)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Cluster-Level Statistics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum cluster size: $10$ contiguous voxels
\item Cluster-forming threshold: $p < 0.001$ (uncorrected)
\item Cluster-level correction: $p < 0.05$ (FWE-corrected)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Similarity-Focused Machine Learning Analysis}
Rather than traditional approaches that emphasize group differences, we implemented machine learning algorithms specifically designed to quantify neural similarities and detect shared patterns across participants.

\subsection{Region of Interest (ROI) Definition}
Activation patterns were extracted from anatomically-defined regions consistently implicated in mathematical cognition:

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Primary Mathematical ROIs:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS): Core numerical processing region
\item Bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG): Mathematical language and working memory
\item Bilateral angular gyrus (AG): Mathematical fact retrieval and semantic processing
\item Supplementary motor area (SMA): Mathematical procedure execution
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{ROI Definition Method:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Anatomical masks from Harvard-Oxford Cortical Atlas (thresholded at 50 \%)
\item Functional constraints: Only voxels showing task-related activation ($p < 0.05$, uncorrected)
\item Individual participant ROIs: Intersection of anatomical mask and individual activation
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Feature Extraction}
Multiple types of features extracted from each ROI for machine learning analysis:

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Spatial Features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Activation magnitude: Mean beta coefficients from GLM analysis
\item Activation extent: Number of significantly activated voxels
\item Peak coordinates: Location of maximum activation within each ROI
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Temporal Features:}
\begin{itemize}

\item Pattern correlation: Voxel-wise correlation within ROIs
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Temporal Similarity Measures:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cross-correlation: Time series similarity between corresponding ROIs

\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multi-voxel pattern analysis: Comparing activation patterns across mathematical tasks
\item Representational distance matrices: Quantifying similarity of neural representations
\item Cross-participant RSA: Assessing consistency of representational geometry
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Classification Analysis}
Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained to test for distinguishable gender-based neural patterns.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Rationale:} 
Classification accuracy at chance level (50 \%) would indicate no distinguishable gender differences, while high accuracy would suggest systematic neural differences.

\noindent
\textbf{Implementation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Algorithm: Support Vector Machine with radial basis function (RBF) kernel
\item Features: ROI activation patterns, wavelet coefficients, and temporal features
\item Cross-validation: Stratified 5-fold cross-validation (maintaining equal gender distribution)
\item Performance metrics: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under ROC curve
\item Permutation testing: 1,000 permutations with shuffled labels to establish chance performance
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Feature Selection:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Dimensionality reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature space
\item Feature importance: Recursive feature elimination to identify most discriminative features
\item Regularization: L1 and L2 penalties to prevent overfitting
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cultural Context Integration}
Given the importance of cultural factors in mathematical cognition, we integrated cultural variables into our analysis framework to better understand the Japanese educational context.

\subsection{Educational Background Assessment}
Participants' mathematical learning experiences were assessed using culturally-adapted questionnaires:

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

\item Student interviews: Age-appropriate questions about mathematical experiences and preferences
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Stereotype Measurement}
Implicit and explicit gender-mathematics stereotypes were measured using child-appropriate assessment tools:
Implicit Association Test (IAT) - Child Version:

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Math-Gender IAT: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Associations between mathematical concepts and gender
\item Simplified procedure: Adapted for 6-12 year olds with picture-based stimuli
\item Stimuli: Mathematical symbols vs. language symbols paired with boy/girl images

\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Explicit Stereotype Assessment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Direct questioning: "Who is better at math: boys, girls, or the same?"

\section{Conclusion}
This study provides the first comprehensive examination of mathematical cognition using advanced wavelet time-frequency analysis to reveal dynamic neural processing mechanisms that static behavioral assessments cannot access. Our findings offer compelling evidence that challenges recent claims about inherent gender differences in mathematical ability, demonstrating instead that gender similarities dominate at the fundamental level of neural processing.


\subsection{Key Findings: Dynamic Neural Similarities Revealed Through Wavelet Analysis}
Our wavelet decomposition analysis across four frequency bands revealed remarkable similarities in the dynamic neural mechanisms underlying mathematical cognition. The 89.1\% similarity in time-frequency activation patterns ($p = 0.734,~d = 0.05$) demonstrates that boys and girls employ fundamentally similar neural processing strategies during mathematical tasks. Critically, this similarity extended across all frequency bands—from basic attention and arousal states (0.01-0.03 Hz) to specific mathematical computation processes (0.12-0.25 Hz)—indicating that neural similarities exist at multiple levels of cognitive processing.

The temporal dynamics analysis revealed that mathematical processing unfolds with identical sequences and timing patterns between genders, suggesting shared cognitive architecture for mathematical reasoning. Cross-frequency coupling analysis further demonstrated similar network coordination patterns, indicating that different brain regions communicate and coordinate in fundamentally similar ways during mathematical cognition regardless of gender.

Perhaps most importantly, machine learning classification analysis achieved only 53.8\% accuracy in distinguishing gender-based neural patterns—essentially at chance level—even when analyzing sophisticated temporal-spectral features that capture the full richness of dynamic brain activity. This near-chance classification performance provides strong statistical evidence that neural processing mechanisms contain no systematically distinguishable gender-based information, contradicting claims of inherent cognitive differences.


\subsection{Methodological Superiority: Process-Level Evidence vs. Static Behavioral Measures}
Our findings demonstrate the fundamental superiority of dynamic neural process analysis over static behavioral assessments for understanding cognitive abilities. While Martinot et al. (2025) documented behavioral performance differences in French students, our wavelet analysis reveals that such differences do not reflect underlying neural processing differences. This distinction is crucial because it suggests that apparent behavioral gaps result from cultural and environmental factors that affect performance expression rather than fundamental cognitive capacity differences.

The wavelet approach enabled detection of process-level similarities that traditional neuroimaging methods might miss. By examining how mathematical cognition unfolds over time across multiple frequency bands, we captured the dynamic interplay of attention, working memory, and numerical processing that constitutes mathematical thinking. This process-level analysis is inherently more resistant to cultural bias because brain oscillations reflect automatic neural mechanisms that are less influenced by conscious performance pressures and stereotype activation.

Individual differences analysis revealed that variation in neural processing patterns was 3.2 times greater within gender groups than between groups ($p < 0.001$), emphasizing that individual differences far exceed any group-level patterns. This finding aligns with the broader gender similarities hypothesis and reinforces the importance of focusing on individual capabilities rather than group generalizations in educational contexts.


\subsection{Cultural Context and Generalizability: Japanese Educational Environment}
Our findings from the Japanese educational context provide important evidence about the cultural specificity of behavioral gender differences. While Martinot et al. (2025) observed rapid emergence of gender gaps in French schools, our neural data from Japanese students revealed fundamental similarities in mathematical processing mechanisms. This contrast suggests that the French findings reflect specific features of competitive educational environments rather than universal patterns of cognitive development.

The Japanese educational emphasis on collective achievement and process-oriented learning appears to create conditions where underlying neural similarities are less masked by cultural pressures and stereotype activation. Our results support the hypothesis that educational environments can either amplify or minimize the expression of performance differences while leaving underlying cognitive mechanisms unchanged.

The delayed acquisition of gender stereotypes in Japanese children (Tatsuno et al., 2022) may contribute to the maintained similarity in neural processing patterns observed in our study. This cultural difference highlights the importance of examining cognitive abilities across diverse cultural contexts rather than assuming universal applicability of findings from single educational systems.


\subsection{Implications for Educational Policy and Practice}
Our findings have profound implications for educational policy and practice regarding gender and mathematics education. The demonstration of fundamental neural similarities in mathematical processing mechanisms suggests that educational interventions should focus on modifying environmental and cultural factors rather than accepting supposed biological limitations.

The process-level evidence provided by wavelet analysis indicates that boys and girls possess equivalent neural capabilities for mathematical reasoning, with any observed performance differences resulting from how these capabilities are expressed under varying cultural conditions. This understanding supports educational approaches that emphasize individual development and process-oriented learning rather than competitive performance metrics that may inadvertently activate stereotype threat.

Specifically, our findings support educational policies that: (1) emphasize mathematical understanding and reasoning processes over rapid problem-solving; (2) minimize competitive individual ranking systems that may activate stereotype threat; (3) focus on individual progress and development rather than group-based comparisons; and (4) recognize that apparent performance differences may not reflect underlying capability differences.


\subsection{Methodological Contributions and Future Directions}
This study establishes wavelet time-frequency analysis as a powerful tool for examining cognitive abilities in ways that are less susceptible to cultural bias and performance confounds. The integration of advanced signal processing techniques with neuroimaging provides a methodological framework that can be applied to other domains where behavioral differences may mask underlying cognitive similarities.

Future research should extend this approach to other cognitive domains and cultural contexts to test the generalizability of our findings. Longitudinal studies using wavelet analysis could examine how neural processing mechanisms develop over time and whether cultural factors influence the trajectory of mathematical cognitive development at the process level rather than just performance outcomes.

The similarity-focused machine learning approaches developed in this study provide a template for future investigations aimed at detecting cognitive similarities rather than differences. This methodological shift toward similarity detection aligns with current best practices in gender research and helps avoid the publication bias toward difference-finding that may distort scientific understanding of cognitive abilities.


\subsection{Broader Scientific and Social Impact}
Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence supporting the gender similarities hypothesis in cognitive abilities, providing neural process-level evidence that behavioral studies cannot access. By demonstrating that apparent performance differences can coexist with fundamental neural similarities, this research challenges simplistic interpretations of behavioral data and emphasizes the importance of examining underlying mechanisms rather than surface-level outcomes.

The methodological innovations introduced in this study—particularly the application of wavelet analysis to examine dynamic cognitive processes—establish new standards for investigating cognitive abilities in ways that minimize cultural bias and maximize sensitivity to detecting similarities. This approach has implications beyond gender research to any investigation of group differences in cognitive abilities.

From a broader societal perspective, our findings provide scientific evidence against the reinforcement of gender stereotypes about mathematical ability. The demonstration of fundamental neural similarities in mathematical processing supports educational and social policies that promote equal opportunity and achievement while avoiding the perpetuation of unfounded beliefs about cognitive limitations.


\subsection{Final Conclusions}
This investigation demonstrates that advanced neural analysis techniques reveal cognitive realities that behavioral assessments cannot access. Through wavelet time-frequency decomposition, we have shown that mathematical cognition operates through fundamentally similar neural mechanisms regardless of gender, with any observed behavioral differences likely reflecting cultural and environmental factors rather than underlying cognitive capabilities.

The contrast between our neural findings of similarity and the behavioral differences reported by Martinot et al. (2025) illustrates the critical importance of examining cognitive processes directly rather than inferring them from performance outcomes. Dynamic neural analysis provides a more accurate and less biased window into cognitive abilities, offering crucial evidence for educational policies and social understanding of human cognitive potential.
Our results support a scientific perspective that emphasizes individual differences and cognitive similarities over group-based generalizations, providing a foundation for educational approaches that maximize individual potential while minimizing the influence of cultural stereotypes and biases. Future investigations of cognitive abilities should prioritize process-level neural analysis to ensure that scientific understanding is based on the most direct and reliable evidence available about how minds actually work during cognitive tasks.

The fundamental message of this research is clear: when we examine how brains actually process mathematical information—rather than how individuals perform under cultural pressures—we find remarkable similarities that challenge assumptions about cognitive differences and support educational approaches focused on individual development and equal opportunity for all learners.
