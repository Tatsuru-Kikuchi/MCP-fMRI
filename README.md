# MCP-fMRI
Performance analysis in math skills especially for the gender difference using fMRI image data.

In these days, generative AI is so powerful in analyzing image data including functional-MRI (fMRI) data which works by identifying areas of the brain that become more active when performing a task, such as thinking, speaking, or moving.

On the other hand, there are some discussions that younger male has a strong ability than the same aged female. Such gender diferrence in math skills might change by time.

In this analysis, we proceed to validate if there are such gender difference exist or not by using generative AI based on the fMRI image data. And if possible, we analyze genetic image data by the generative AI.
