================================================================================\nWAVELET ANALYSIS REPORT - MATHEMATICAL COGNITION fMRI STUDY\n================================================================================\n\nANALYSIS OVERVIEW:\n• Wavelet type: morlet\n• Sampling rate: 0.5 Hz\n• Data shape: 1000 voxels × 200 timepoints\n\nFREQUENCY BAND ANALYSIS:\n• VERY_SLOW BAND (0.010-0.030 Hz):\n  - Mean activation: 0.0186\n  - Std deviation: 0.0415\n  - Peak activation: 0.1517\n  - Active voxels (>0): 324 (32.4%)\n• SLOW BAND (0.030-0.060 Hz):\n  - Mean activation: -0.0049\n  - Std deviation: 0.0120\n  - Peak activation: 0.0398\n  - Active voxels (>0): 139 (13.9%)\n• MEDIUM BAND (0.060-0.120 Hz):\n  - Mean activation: -0.0036\n  - Std deviation: 0.0150\n  - Peak activation: 0.0430\n  - Active voxels (>0): 201 (20.1%)\n• FAST BAND (0.120-0.250 Hz):\n  - Mean activation: -0.0002\n  - Std deviation: 0.0093\n  - Peak activation: 0.0373\n  - Active voxels (>0): 248 (24.8%)\n\nSIMILARITY ANALYSIS (Ethical Focus):\n• Cross-band similarity: 0.072\n• This analysis emphasizes neural similarities rather than differences\n• Individual variation patterns are preserved while highlighting commonalities\n\nDETECTED BRAIN REGIONS:\n• VERY_SLOW BAND:\n  - Number of clusters: 0\n  - Total active voxels: 50\n  - Mean activation in active regions: 0.0158\n  - Peak activation: 0.1517\n• SLOW BAND:\n  - Number of clusters: 0\n  - Total active voxels: 50\n  - Mean activation in active regions: -0.0147\n  - Peak activation: 0.0398\n• MEDIUM BAND:\n  - Number of clusters: 0\n  - Total active voxels: 50\n  - Mean activation in active regions: -0.0066\n  - Peak activation: 0.0430\n• FAST BAND:\n  - Number of clusters: 0\n  - Total active voxels: 50\n  - Mean activation in active regions: -0.0022\n  - Peak activation: 0.0373\n\nINTERPRETATION NOTES:\n• Results show time-frequency decomposition of BOLD signals during math tasks\n• Higher activation in slow frequencies may indicate sustained attention\n• Medium frequency activation often relates to working memory processes\n• Individual differences should be considered alongside group patterns\n\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n• This analysis emphasizes similarities across participants\n• Results should not be used to make discriminatory conclusions\n• Individual variation is respected and highlighted\n• Cultural and social factors should be considered in interpretation\n\n================================================================================
